# E-Commerce React App
This project is a simple e-commerce web application built with ReactJS that uses the Fake Store API to fetch product data. The app allows users to browse products, add/remove items to/from the cart, and view their cart contents, including quantity adjustments and a dynamic total price.

## Features
- Product List: Displays a list of products with key information like image, title, price, and description.
- Responsive Layout: The product grid and cart are designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Add to Cart: Users can add products to the cart. If a product is already in the cart, they can remove it.
- Cart Management: View items in the cart, adjust quantities, and see a 10% discount applied to the total price.
- Dynamic Total: The cart page dynamically updates the total price based on product quantities.
- Routing: The app includes proper routing between the product listing and cart pages.

## Tech Stack
- ReactJS: Front-end framework used for building the application.
- React Router: For handling navigation between the product page and cart page.
- JavaScript (ES6): Application logic and functionality.
- HTML/CSS: For structure and styling of the components.

## Usage
- Homepage: Browse the products fetched from the Fake Store API.
- Add to Cart: Click the "Add to Cart" button on any product to add it to your cart.
- Cart Page: Navigate to the cart page using the navbar link. Adjust quantities or remove items directly from the cart.
